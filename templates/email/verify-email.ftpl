Dear user,

you, or someone else created an account on %{site_url}.
You will need to verify that this is your email address.
To do so, please go to this link:
%{verify_link}

If you did not sign up, please notify us and we will 
suspend the account.

If you signed up with a valid referral token, you will 
automatically be able to create new studies (rather 
than just take part).
If you have no such token, please reply to this email 
and tell us why you should get access (we're happy 
about new users, but want to know a little about what 
you plan to do).

To get help with conducting studies, refer to the help 
section here.
We have provided copious documentation and some detailed 
HowTos, but there also is a mailing list to which you 
can write if you need more help. 
%{documentation_url}

While you have a live study on formr, you should be 
signed up to the mailing list, so that you hear 
quickly if there will be a big update or if there
might be trouble with formr. 
There are fewer than two messages per month on the list.

Best regards,

formr robots
