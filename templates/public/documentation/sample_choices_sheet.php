<h3>Choices Spreadsheet</h3><hr />

<p>
Choices sheets are fairly simple. The <code>list_name</code> column defines the choice set. By using that name in the type column of a multiple-choice item, you assign that choice set. As you'd expect, the <code>name</code> column defines the value recorded in the database, the <code>label</code> defines what participants see by default. It is not currently possible to randomly order choice sets. You can use Javascript to achieve this.
